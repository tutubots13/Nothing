Absolutely! Here are some fun and creative coding tasks that use similar techniques as the code you provided. These tasks will help you practice concepts like lists, functions, user input, error handling, and loops. Let’s get started!

### Task 1: Favorite Snacks Tracker

**Objective**: Create a program to track your favorite snacks and how many times you’ve eaten each one.

1. **Initialize the Lists**:
   - Create a list called `snacks` with your top 5 favorite snacks.
   - Create a list called `snack_count` initialized with zeros to keep track of how many times you’ve eaten each snack.

2. **Function**: 
   - Write a function called `log_snack(snack_name)` that increases the count of the specified snack by 1.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Use a loop to ask the user which snack they want to log (or type 'exit' to finish).
   - Call the `log_snack` function for valid snack names, and handle the case where the snack is not found.

4. **Print Summary**: 
   - After exiting the loop, print a summary of each snack and how many times you’ve eaten it.

### Task 2: Simple To-Do List

**Objective**: Build a simple to-do list application where you can add tasks and mark them as done.

1. **Initialize the Lists**:
   - Create a list called `tasks` to hold your to-do items.
   - Create a list called `completed` initialized with `False` for each task to indicate if it’s done or not.

2. **Function**:
   - Write a function called `mark_done(task_name)` that marks the specified task as done by changing the corresponding `completed` value to `True`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Use a loop to allow the user to add tasks (by typing them in) or mark tasks as done (by entering the task name).
   - Handle the case where the task is not found and give feedback.

4. **Print List**:
   - After exiting the loop, print out the list of tasks along with their completion status (done or not done).

### Task 3: Movie Watchlist Tracker

**Objective**: Create a program to keep track of movies you want to watch and how many times you’ve watched each one.

1. **Initialize the Lists**:
   - Create a list called `movies` with some movie titles you want to watch.
   - Create a list called `watch_count` initialized with zeros to track how many times you’ve watched each movie.

2. **Function**:
   - Write a function called `log_movie(movie_name)` that increases the watch count for the specified movie by 1.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Use a loop to ask the user which movie they want to log (or type 'exit' to finish).
   - Call the `log_movie` function for valid movie names, and handle the case where the movie is not found.

4. **Print Summary**:
   - After exiting the loop, print a summary of each movie and how many times you’ve watched it.

### Task 4: Daily Exercise Log

**Objective**: Build a program to track your daily exercise routine.

1. **Initialize the Lists**:
   - Create a list called `exercises` with various exercises you do (like running, cycling, yoga).
   - Create a list called `exercise_time` initialized with zeros to track how many hours you’ve spent on each exercise.

2. **Function**:
   - Write a function called `log_exercise(exercise_name, hours)` that adds the specified hours to the corresponding exercise.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Use a loop to ask the user which exercise they want to log and how many hours they did (or type 'exit' to finish).
   - Call the `log_exercise` function for valid exercise names, and handle the case where the exercise is not found.

4. **Print Summary**:
   - After exiting the loop, print a summary of each exercise and the total hours spent on it.

### Task 5: Book Reading Log

**Objective**: Create a program to keep track of books you want to read and how many pages you’ve read from each one.

1. **Initialize the Lists**:
   - Create a list called `books` with titles of books you want to read.
   - Create a list called `pages_read` initialized with zeros to track how many pages you’ve read from each book.

2. **Function**:
   - Write a function called `log_pages(book_name, pages)` that adds the specified number of pages to the corresponding book.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Use a loop to ask the user which book they want to log and how many pages they read (or type 'exit' to finish).
   - Call the `log_pages` function for valid book names, and handle the case where the book is not found.

4. **Print Summary**:
   - After exiting the loop, print a summary of each book and how many pages have been read.

### Tips for Completing These Tasks

- **Start Simple**: Begin with initializing the lists and the main loop. Once you have that working, add the functions.
- **Test as You Go**: Run your code after each major change to catch any mistakes early.
- **Be Creative**: Feel free to add extra features, like allowing the user to remove tasks or reset counts!

By completing these tasks, you’ll reinforce your understanding of lists, functions, user input, and loops, just like in the original code you provided. Have fun coding, and let your creativity shine! If you have any questions along the way, feel free to ask!
